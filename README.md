# Data-visualization_Sublime-s-Lime-graphs_Matplotlib_Python_Codecademy
Hi there,
The project showcases an understanding and application of data visualization (graphs) in Python through the use of Matplotlib.
The purpose is to present the findings through visual, formatted graphs.

Sublime Limes' Line Graphs
In this project, you will be acting as a data analyst for an online lime retailer called Sublime Limes. People all over the world can use this product to get the freshest, best-quality limes delivered to their door. One of the product managers at Sublime Limes would like to gain insight into the customers and their sales habits. Using Matplotlib, youâ€™ll create some different line graphs (or maybe, lime graphs) to communicate this information effectively.
